## Features and improvements

### Centralization of experimental declarations

For improving the readability of our [API reference], and for making a clear
separation between **stable** declarations and **experimental** ones,
we've decided to move **experimental** declarations to the
`kotools.types.experimental` package.

This way, [Java] users will know when calling an experimental declaration just
by reading its package instead of reading the documentation for finding an
experimental annotation on it (the [opt-in] mechanism provided by [Kotlin]
doesn't work on [Java]).

[kotlin]: https://kotlinlang.org
[opt-in]: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/opt-in-requirements.html

### New `EmailAddress` type

Like suggested by [@MichaelStH] in [#55], we've introduced an **experimental**
type for representing an email address: the `EmailAddress` type.

```kotlin
val address: EmailAddress = EmailAddress.create("contact@kotools.org")
println(address) // contact@kotools.org
```

This type is available on all platforms, even for [Java] users!

```java
final EmailAddress address =
        EmailAddress.Companion.create("contact@kotools.org");
System.out.println(address); // contact@kotools.org
```

Also, the `EmailAddress` type is serializable and its processes behave like for
the `String` type.
So no need to worry about wrapping your email address strings in additional
objects!

```kotlin
val address: EmailAddress = EmailAddress.create("contact@kotools.org")
val encoded: String = Json.encodeToString(address)
println(encoded) // "contact@kotools.org"
val decoded: EmailAddress = Json.decodeFromString(encoded)
println(decoded == address) // true
```

This type being **experimental**, we need your feedback before stabilizing it
and your ideas for improving its usage.
So feel free to give them to us by [creating a discussion].
